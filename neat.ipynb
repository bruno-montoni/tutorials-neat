    "# ```NEAT``` Tutorial #\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is ```NEAT```? ###\n",
    "NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (```NEAT```) is an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks (```NN```).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instalation ###\n",
    "```NEAT``` can be installed via ```pip3 install neat-python``` and ```pip3 install visualize```.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Methodolgy ###\n",
    "**Overview**<br>\n",
    "In ```NEAT```, a population of individual ```genomes``` is maintained, and each ```genome``` contains 2 types of ```genes``` that describe how to build neural networks:\n",
    "- ```Node```: specify a single ```neuron``` (all existing are mapped);\n",
    "- ```Connection```: specify a ```connection``` between ```neurons``` from a previous layer to a following layer (all existing/potential are mapped);\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ```node gene``` has the following attributes:\n",
    "- ```ID```: unique identifier;\n",
    "- ```Layer Type```: either ```sensor``` (input layer) or ```hidden``` (hidden layer);\n",
    "- ```IO```: either ```input``` (```predictor```) or ```output``` (```response```);\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ```connection gene``` has the following attributes:\n",
    "- ```Input Node```: which node starts the connection;\n",
    "- ```Output Node```: which node ends the connection;\n",
    "- ```Weight```: the connection strength;\n",
    "- ```Enabled```: either ```enabled``` (if both ```input node``` and ```output node``` exist; i.e. gene is manifested);\n",
    "- ```Innovation```: identify the original historical ancestry;\n",
    "\n",
    "A ```fitness function``` computes a single real number *indicating the quality of a genome* (where the higher the score, the higher ability to solve the problem). ```NEAT``` progresses through a pre-defined number of ```generations```, where each is produced by ```reproduction``` and ```mutation``` of the *most fit individuals of the previous generation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Reproduction```/```Mutation``` *may add nodes/connections and/or change ```weights```*, making ```genomes``` (and their associated ```NN```s) more and more complex as ```generations``` progress. When the preset number of ```generations``` is reached, or at least one individual exceeds the the pre-defined ```fitness threshold```, the algorithm ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gene Tracking with ```Innovation```**<br>\n",
    "To perform ```crossover```, ```NEAT``` must be able to tell which ```genes``` match up between individuals in the population. Two genes that have the same ```connection innovation``` (historical origin) *represent the same structure* (possibly with different ```weights```).\n",
    "\n",
    "```Innovation``` is a global unique number that represent a chronology of every ```gene``` in the system (and sticks with it even *when passed to offspring*). Whenever a new gene appears (through structural ```mutation```), ```innovation``` is incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Genes``` that *do not match* are either ```disjoint``` or ```excess```, depending on whether they *occur within/outside the range of the other parent’s ```innovation``` numbers*. We can assume ```NEAT``` treats them without distinction and that the intention was to further investigate those options (which didn't happen).\n",
    "\n",
    "When ```crossing over```, the ```genes``` with the same ```innovation``` are lined up. *Genes that do not match are inherited from the more fit parent* (or from both, randomly, if parents are equally fit). This results in a cheap process that doesn't need expensive topological analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protecting Innovation through Speciation**<br> \n",
    "```NEAT``` *speciates the population*, so that individuals *compete primarily within their own niches instead of with the population at large*. Speciation guarantees that *topological innovations are protected and have time to optimize their structure before they compete with other niches in the population*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the algorithm divides the population into species (based on topological similarity), the *number of ```disjoint```/```excess``` genes between a pair of ```genomes``` becomes a measure of their compatibility*. We can measure the compatibility distance (```delta```) as a linear combination of the number of excess (```E```) and disjoint (```D```) genes. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a ```genome```’s distance to a randomly chosen member of the species is less than ```delta_t``` (threshold), it's placed into this species (*```genomes``` are placed into the first species where this condition is satisfied*). In ```explicit fitness sharing``` *individuals in the same species must share the fitness of their niche, making it difficult for any species to take over the entire population*. Species fitnesses are first adjusted by dividing by the number of individuals in the species and, thus, setting the new number of individuals in species (they'll grow/shrink depending on whether their average adjusted fitness is above/below the population average).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration File Description ###\n",
